# Advent of Code 2021

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) is a set of small yearly programming problems for a variety of skill levels. They can be solved in any programming language; this year I chose Rust.

I've never done a non-trivial program in Rust, so this is a learning experience for me. Fair warning, probably don't look here for best practices (although I'm trying to do better).

### What's Included?
Included are working solutions for all 25 days of problems (parts 1 and 2). Each day gets its on module (folder and `mod.rs` file). The code is commented with my thought process and a rough outline of the algorithm.

### Running the Code
If Rust is installed on the machine, you can run the code with `cargo run <day>` using the `day` variable to specify what days should be run. You may specify multiple days.

Examples:
```sh
cargo run day1
cargo run day4 day5 day6
```
